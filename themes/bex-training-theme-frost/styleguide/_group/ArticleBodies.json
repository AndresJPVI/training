      "<p>Despite sharing the court with superstars like Apolo Ohno, Dikembe Mutombo, Dale Moss, and Drew Baldwin, the star of the Special Olympics Unified Floorball game quickly proved to be the young man in goal who nobody knew before the match began. As the teams took to the court, Kydon Mena, a goalie from Special Olympics Gibraltar made his way to the front of the net with assistance from his teammate, Apolo Ohno. Mena, who lives with cerebral palsy, is unable to walk on his own. In floorball, however, goalies play on their knees, which turns Mena’s disability into a unique advantage. As the match progressed, Mena made save after save, leaving his teammates and the fans watching awed by his courage, determination, and skill. Mena’s memorable performance was one of many during the Unified Sports Experiences at the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria.<p>For the third straight World Games, a team of employees from Perfect Sense coordinated the Unified Sports Experiences, a series of exhibition competitions that pair Special Olympics athletes with foreign dignitaries, celebrities, professional athletes, and other honored guests as teammates. Unified Sports Experiences aim to change perceptions and create greater understanding by inspiring communities not only to play unified, but also to live unified.",
